## Hi there 👋
I’m a technical artist with a generalist background. Formally, I have a bachelor's in Computer Graphics and specialize in rigging, but I write scripts for just about anything. 
Mainly using Maya's Command API in Python, but occasionally Maya MEL, Houdini VEX, but also dabble in Google App Scripts, iOS Scriptable JavaScript, and C#.
